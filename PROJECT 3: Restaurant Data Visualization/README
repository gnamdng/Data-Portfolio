Project 3 is the continuation of Project 2. 
After successfully creating the cash register using VBA, the collected data was then used to create the restaurant dashboard.

Prior to creating the dashboard, i completed some steps to use the data: collecting the data,
cleaning the data (headers changing, column/rows deleting) and running some tests for pivot tables.

The result is an interactive dashboard for the restaurant with the needed informations, this first visualization is quite basic.

Project 3 is the continuation of Project 2. 
After successfully creating the cash register using VBA, the collected data was then used to create the restaurant dashboard.

Before creating the dashboard, i completed several steps to prepare the data: collecting, cleaning (changing headers, 
deleting column/rows) and running some tests for pivot tables.

The result is an interactive dashboard for the restaurant with the necessary informations required, 
this is my first data visualization so it looks pretty basic.
